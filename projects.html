                    <p>The SleepPod tracks and analyzes various sleep aspects to promote health 
                        and well-being. It monitors snoring, palpitations, hyperventilation, breathing 
                        lapses, and sleep disturbances, while optimizing the sleep environment by 
                        managing external factors. The hardware includes microphones, sound meters, 
                        respiratory and heart rate sensors, and environmental sensors for temperature, 
                        humidity, and noise. These components work with sound analytics software to 
                        process audio data. The device, placed on a nightstand, uses filtering techniques 
                        to minimize echo and stores audio files on a memory card or in real-time, 
                        transferring them to the cloud for analysis. Security is ensured through 
                        end-to-end encryption. The system focuses on sleep patterns, deprivation, and 
                        age-related factors to provide insights for improving sleep quality and well-being, 
                        though it is not for diagnostic purposes.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Mirror Mirror on the Wall - CSV</h3> <!-- This is the subheading -->
                    <p>The project involves developing a smart mirror platform with a Raspberry Pi and a 
                        custom two-way mirror to provide an interactive hub for real-time information and 
                        hands-free functionality through Amazon's Alexa. The mirror will overlay digital 
                        content onto the reflection, creating a dynamic interface. The Raspberry Pi will 
                        handle data processing, API interactions, and the user interface.<br><br>API 
                        integrations such as Spotify for music and WeatherApp for weather forecasts will 
                        display real-time data on the mirror. Alexa's functionality will be enhanced to offer 
                        intuitive, context-aware interactions, providing a streamlined, voice-controlled 
                        experience that emphasizes ease of use and accessibility.

                    <h4>Music Player</h4>
                    <p>In the circuit implementation, a voltage regulator converts the 9V battery voltage 
                        to a stable 5V output. The regulator's first pin connects to the positive terminal 
                        of the battery, the second pin to the negative terminal of a capacitor and the 
                        ground rail of the breadboard, while the third pin provides the 5V supply to the 
                        circuit. The microcontroller is powered by connecting its VCC pin to the positive 
                        terminal and its GND pin to the negative terminal of the breadboard.<br><br>The 
                        keypad is connected to Port C of the microcontroller, with the rows linked to pins 
                        PC0–PC3 and columns to pins PC4–PC7. Three 1000-ohm resistors connect between the 
                        negative terminal and the VO pin of the LCD. The LCD's RS, R/W, and EN pins connect 
                        to Port B0, B1, and B2 for control. Data passes through Port D's DB0–DB7 pins. 
                        A 0.1uF capacitor connects the speaker to the microcontroller via Port PB3. The 
                        keypad is used to select songs (A, B, C, D), and the MCU displays the song name on 
                        the LCD. Tempo and pitch keys adjust preferences, updating the notes played through 
                        the speaker.</p>
