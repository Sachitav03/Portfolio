                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
                <p>
                    I am a recent Computer Science and Engineering graduate from the 
                    University of California, Irvine (March 2025), with a passion for 
                    building embedded systems and creating user-focused, technically 
                    robust solutions.<br><br>
                    
                    My journey into tech began with community tutoring during the 
                    pandemic—teaching mathematics and introductory programming to 
                    underprivileged students—where I realized how impactful accessible 
                    technology can be.<br><br>
                    
                    Since then, I have evolved into a hands-on engineer, taking on 
                    projects that merge hardware and software in meaningful ways. 
                    Currently, I am developing a Sleep Quality Monitoring System, which 
                    uses sensor and sound data to analyze sleep patterns—an ongoing 
                    project focused on signal processing, hardware interfacing, and 
                    intelligent feedback.<br><br>
                    
                    Alongside that, I recently led the development of a Smart Mirror 
                    for my senior design capstone: a voice-enabled system that 
                    integrates real-time weather and Spotify APIs using a Raspberry 
                    Pi and custom UI overlay, with full hardware-software coordination.<br><br>
                    
                    Previously, I built an AVR-based music player using an ATmega32 
                    microcontroller, where I designed circuits, handled audio output 
                    with DACs and amplifiers, and managed precise button-controlled 
                    playback—all of which deepened my understanding of real-time 
                    embedded design and low-level communication protocols.<br><br>
                    
                    My skill set spans across C++, Python, Java, embedded C, 
                    Linux-based development, digital circuit design, I2C/SPI/GPIO 
                    interfaces, signal integrity, and front-end technologies like 
                    HTML/CSS. I have also worked on database automation and UI 
                    improvements during my time as a Student Coordinator for UCI 
                    Student Housing, where I streamlined operational workflows 
                    through accessible design.<br><br>
                    
                    What ties all these experiences together is a drive to blend 
                    hardware intuition, software problem-solving, and creative systems 
                    thinking to engineer products that are efficient, purposeful, and 
                    human-centered.
