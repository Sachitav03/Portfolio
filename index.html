                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a Senior at the University of California, Irvine, 
                    pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. My journey into 
                    technology has been shaped by a curiosity for problem-solving and a 
                    drive to create impactful solutions. Alongside my studies, I've explored 
                    diverse opportunities ranging from embedded systems development to web 
                    and UI/UX design.Originally, I began with community-oriented roles 
                    during the pandemic, teaching mathematics and programming to underserved 
                    communities. As my interest in technology deepened, I transitioned into 
                    more technical projects such as designing a Smart Mirror with 
                    voice-enabled controls, building a sleep quality monitoring system, and 
                    developing an AVR-based music player.<br>Whether managing marketing 
                    strategies at UCI or participating in hackathon projects, I strive to 
                    bring creativity, adaptability, and collaboration to every challenge. 
                    My multifaceted background reflects a commitment to blending technical 
                    expertise with user-focused innovation.<br> <br>
                    Currently, I am deeply immersed in several technical and leadership 
                    roles. As a Senior at the University of California, Irvine, I am actively 
                    collaborating on a Smart Mirror project, integrating voice control and 
                    real-time API data. Simultaneously, I am refining my work on a Sleep 
                    Quality Monitoring System using sensor-driven analytics and working on 
                    innovative embedded systems like an AVR-based music player.<br>Beyond 
                    academics, I stay engaged by contributing to UCI's community as a 
                    Student Coordinator for Arroyo Vista Housing, where I enhance operational
                     efficiency through automation and accessibility-focused design. I also 
                     participate in hackathons, leveraging my coding expertise in Python, 
                     Java, and front-end technologies to create user-centric solutions. 
                     These experiences embody my passion for combining technology and 
                     creativity to make a meaningful impact.<br>
